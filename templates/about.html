        <p>
          SkillSwap is a friendly, community-powered platform where anyone can share what they know and learn what they’ve always wanted to.
          Whether you’re an expert in your craft or just starting out, this is your space to connect, grow, and support one another.
          We believe learning should be accessible, social, and enjoyable. From creative arts to coding, from cooking to public speaking —
          we’ve made it easy for you to meet like-minded people, exchange knowledge, and build something meaningful together.

        <p><strong>Built by Learners</strong><br>We’re a team of students who created SkillSwap to turn learning into a shared, community experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Passionate About People</strong><br>We believe everyone has something to teach — and we wanted to build a space where that knowledge can be shared freely.</p>
        <p><strong>More Than Just a Project</strong><br>SkillSwap started as a college project, but quickly became something we are proud to offer to anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning Together</strong><br>At the heart of SkillSwap is connection — where people grow by sharing what they know and learning something new in return.</p>
